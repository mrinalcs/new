<p>At the core of the “less is more” ethos is the appreciation for simplicity as a design principle. By paring down elements to their fundamental forms, artists create a visual language that is both elegant and accessible. The beauty of simplicity lies in its ability to evoke emotions without overwhelming the viewer.</p>

<p>“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” - Leonardo da Vinci</p>

<p>In the pursuit of minimalism, the discerning artist becomes an editor, carefully selecting and discarding elements until only the essential remains. This process requires a keen eye for detail and an understanding that every component contributes to the overall impact of the piece.</p>
